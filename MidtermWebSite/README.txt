This is a basic website made for an HTML/CSS class for college. It was made to demonstrate basic comprehension of HTML/CSS concepts, hence the simplicity and outdated design patterns. We were given the freedom to choose a theme for the site, so I decided to go with a site promoting First Nation artwork. Images are only used as examples, and were used for educational purpose. I claim no ownership of them.
