This a final project website made for a class teaching fundementals of HTML and CSS. It is essentially an extension of the Mid-Term website, repurposed to add extra small features and themed around a personal website. Like the midterm-page, the site is extremely basic and doesn't reflect modern standards. Again most images and assets were pulled from the web and used to populate the page, and were used for educational purposes. The photo of the Custom 22 and the music file are the only files of my own, the rest were pulled from google, some were photoshopped and added.
