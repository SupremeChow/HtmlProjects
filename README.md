# HtmlProjects
Extremely Basic Websites made for class teaching fundementals of HTML and CSS. The class didn't teach modern practices, so these sites are overglorified Geocity pages. Most resources and assets like images were pulled from Google, I claim no ownership of most of them. Few are pictures of my own.
